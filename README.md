# CF-ARCHIVE
# ðŸ§  MY Competitive Programming Archive

Welcome to my tactical archive â€” a curated vault of problems I've solved across Codeforces, LeetCode, AtCoder, and CodeChef. This isn't just a collection of ACs â€” it's a reflection of my growth, discipline, and contest mindset.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This archive helps me:
- Track my progress across platforms
- Annotate edge cases, tactical fixes, and learning notes
- Prepare for online tests and contests at BUET with precision
- Stay contest-ready even on mobile before varsity rounds

## ðŸ§© Structure

Each folder contains:
- `main.cpp` â€” final accepted solution
- `notes.txt` â€” edge cases, failed attempts, tactical insights
- `archive.md` â€” annotated summary for future reference
